# Ionic 2 Has Moved!

You can now find Ionic2's development in the `2.0` branch, within the `ionic` repo: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/tree/2.0

We're currently in the process of moving our issues over to the `ionic` repo.

Moving forward we'll have all issues created through our [Ionitron Issues Form](http://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/), and properly label v1 and v2 issues.

### Ionic Version Roadmap

- Ionic v1 will stay the master branch
- Ionic v2 will be developed within the `2.0` branch
- Post Ionic v2 beta, v1 will move to the `1.x` branch
- Ionic v2 will become the v1 branch
